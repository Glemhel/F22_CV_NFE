# :robot: Neural Face Editor (NFE) :art:

Neural Face Editor - edit your images with power of GAN's and SoTA methods!

NFE is a tool that allows anyone to edit their anime pictures using Deep Learning to change attributes such as hair colour, hair length, eye colour etc.

The project is mainly inspired by works on interpreting the latent space of GANs for people face generation [1] and other methods of manipulating GAN output [2]. It leverages techniques mentioned in the papers to edit real usersâ€™ photos, change multiple image features, and preserve the general image content. These features for editing would probably include hair colour, eye colour, etc., which are not explored in the previous works.
